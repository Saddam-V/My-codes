Happiness is a choice. Peace is a state of mind. Both are free!
We suffer more often in imagination than in reality
He who knows that enough is enough will always have enough
Peace begins with a smile.
Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love
When it rains, look for rainbows; when itâ€™s dark, look for stars
The beautiful journey of today can only begin when we learn to let go of yesterday
Happiness is not something ready made. It comes from your own actions.
It is never too late to be what you might have been
With the new day comes new strength and new thoughts
No matter what happens, or how bad it seems today, life does go on, and it will be better tomorrow
