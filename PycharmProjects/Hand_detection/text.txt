 answers to the three questions?
Write each answer separately.
 Which answer do you like
most, and why?

 the hermit said that there
is only one important time 'Now'.
 It is the only time when
you have power to act.

the hermit said that
the most important person is the one 
with whom we are at
the present.
In response to king's second question,
 the hermit answered
that the most important thing to do is to
do that person good.

time has the supreme power.

also make you fall on
ground if you won;t act in
